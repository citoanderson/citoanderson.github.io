    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">I’ve put together analyses of all the different complaints about BYU-Idaho I’ve heard throughout my time here.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Driving&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">There’s a surprising amount of traffic on campus, especially on a Sunday. It makes getting to church on time very difficult. The small campus streets are lined with cars, all trying to make it to their different sacrament meetings on time. I wouldn’t have this problem at a different university where the LDS population is significantly smaller. I wouldn’t be surrounded by so many positive influences, but at least I’d be able to make it to church on time.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Weather</p>
    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;Warm weather isn’t the norm here, and the freezing temperatures in January (and sometimes August) are the most common subjects of weather-related complaints. We mustn’t forget the summer weather though! It’s difficult to focus on school when it’s warm outside. The Tetons and Yellowstone are both close enough for me to run away from my homework and enjoy the beautiful forests and lakes both of these parks offer. If I went to a different university, with milder weather and fewer National Parks, I don’t think I’d have any problem turning my homework in on time.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Class</p>
    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;It is hard to stay focused in class: I wish my professors weren’t so interested in connecting with their students. I’m tired of getting to know my professors. Semester after semester, they take time out of their schedule to form relationships with me and my classmates. It’s exhausting! I don’t care if they want to help me with an extracurricular project, I’m in this class to learn about sentence structure! I wouldn’t have this problem at a different school. I envy my friends’ experiences at other universities, where the professors prioritize education and stay out of their students’ lives. Imagine how much more I could learn about the English language if personal relationships were completely off the table. Campus&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Rexburg is a flat, flat city. You wouldn’t guess that after spending one day walking around BYU-Idaho’s campus, though. It seems that it was built on the only hill in Rexburg. Walking around this campus for the better part of three years has given me the lower body of an Olympic sprinter. If I had not already grown numb to the physical strain required of me as a student at this university, I wouldn’t notice all the smiling faces around campus. Everyone is so friendly (or supportive of my efforts to sculpt my calves, I can’t tell) and now that I notice it, the pain is almost worth it. Attending this school isn’t for the faint of heart: bad traffic, diverse weather conditions, classroom distractions, and a literal mountain all work together to weed out weak students.</p>
    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;To those reading this who are somehow able to look past all these challenges, how? </p>
