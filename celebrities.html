    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column"> With my increased use of dating apps, I’ve decided to write a couple of pieces that reflect my newfound interest. This piece will discuss the apps I would have matched with my celebrity crushes, the first conversation on the app, and the outcome of our relationship.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Karen Allen - Tinder&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Probably my first celebrity crush. She’s Indiana Jones’ girlfriend in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Smalls’ mom in The Sandlot. My love for older women definitely stems from her character in the latter, and I don’t feel ashamed to admit it. Because we’re on Tinder, she or I would lead with something flirty but not strong enough that I scare her away. I was thinking something along the lines of, “have we met? Because I think that you look like my next ex-girlfriend. This lets her know my intentions, but still keep it playful and light. She and I will start to date casually, but it would never progress because of our differing opinions on raising children. I think that they should grow up playing baseball but seeing Smalls get hit in the eye with one while filming The Sandlot would keep her away from it for good.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Tina Fey - Hinge&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Not the woman I’ve had a crush on the longest, but probably the love of my life. After having matched with her on Hinge, I would have led with a pickup line that reflects my admiration for her sense of humor more than the physical attraction I feel for her. I’d lead with something along the lines of, “on a scale of one to ten, you’re a nine because I’m the one you need.” This is elegant, displays an appropriate amount of physical attraction, and shows that I appreciate her intelligence by including a math problem in my pickup line. Tina and I would date for two years, ending when we acknowledged our creative differences. We were only with each other because of how funny we were when we were together. We’d still be on good terms, but never hanging out one on one again. Every once in a while, I’d call her with a joke I’m trying out but we’d end up spending an hour on the phone catching up with each other. She’s the one who got away&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Selena Gomez - Upward&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">I once saw a picture of her wearing a cross during a performance, so this works. I’m not on this app for anything other than practicing my pickup lines, so I’d need a pickup line catered specifically for this Christian-themed dating app. Something like, “Hey girl. The Bible teaches us to think about what is pure and lovely so I’ve been thinking about you all day.” My knowledge of the Bible is put on display, and my physical attraction is known. I don’t know if she’ll respond, I don’t even know if she’d be on this app. I think anyone wearing a giant cross around their neck should be subjected to any cringey Christian pickup lines I can find on the internet. Selena and I would most likely not date, but we’d stay pretty good friends and go to each other’s church services.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Ryan Gosling - Mutual</p>
    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;I don’t really feel any attraction towards Ryan Gosling, but who wouldn’t swipe up on him? Especially if he were on Mutual. I would be so shocked that he and I matched, that I wouldn’t even try to respond. I’d think about unmatching with him so I wouldn’t be disappointed if he never messaged me yet, but I would wait. He would respond shortly after we matched, with a respectful pickup line like, “If you were a vegetable, you’d be a cute-cumber.” I would blush and while I was thinking of a response he’d text again saying “Hey bro, your pictures look cool! Could you tell me about the bike ride you went on?” I’d tell him about my 100 mile bike ride and we would set a day where we were both free to go on a little ride around a park where we would get a light lunch and some treats. We would talk about my favorite movies of his (Remember the Titans and The Nice Guys) and he would tell me about his favorite movies. We’d spend the rest of the afternoon riding back to his home, he’d give me a bro hug and a fist bump, and then we’d plan on another bike ride next Saturday at a different park.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Emma Stone - Bumble&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Emma Stone would have definitely swiped up on me because of my uncanny resemblance to both Andrew Garfield and Ryan Gosling. I would have swiped up on her because, well, she’s Emma Stone. Bumble requires that the female side of the match message first. For this to happen, my bio would have to be interesting enough to elicit conversation. After including enough pictures that would show that I’m a mysterious adventure loving man who loves dogs, she would match with me. She’d be so compelled to ask about the adventures portrayed in my pictures, and a conversation resulting in both of us falling in love would have to follow. Our relationship would last the longest, ending up in marriage. It would be hard with her busy filming schedule, but Ryan Gosling’s newfound friendship would help me get through the times when she was away. &nbsp;</p>
