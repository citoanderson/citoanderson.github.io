    <p class="text_column">Traffic sucks. So does driving. I listened to music when I drove to work to make the commute much more bearable. Recently, I was driving to work and, having seen the film Holes the night before, I decided to put that on. Thirty minutes of songs, I wouldn’t be able to finish it on my 15 minute drive to State Farm’s campus. Thirty minutes later, I had finished up the soundtrack and realized that I had missed the exit to maybe make it to work on time and avoid traffic. I looked at my maps app to find that I still had another 25 minutes of traffic to get through. I let Holes continue on as I stared at the brake lights of the car in front of me. “I should really text her,” I said. “I like her, and I think she likes me too! We spent a lot of time together last week, and I felt a connection. I think we’d be happy together. We’d also look really cute together.” I rambled on this vein of conversation until I realized how unhealthy it was to think about a future with someone who I wasn’t dating. In a desperate attempt to change the conversation, I blurted out “Moby sounds good. Maybe I should listen to him more often.” This thought tends to make an appearance whenever I listen to this soundtrack, and successfully distracts me from thinking about my fake marriage with her. “It’s underrated in my personal library, I should really listen to more of his music.” Unfortunately, I never listen to more Moby. I don’t like to branch away from my favorites. “I should text her.” I noticed an attractive commuter in the next lane over, “do you think she’s single?” Just a reminder, I am the only person in my car at this time. This question is directed only to myself, and possibly the object of this question if she can read my lips or hear my thoughts. “Is it at all possible to read thoughts?” No. If it were, she’d probably be freaking out right now. “Dang, this song is good. I liked Moby’s better though, I want to hear it again.” Another attempt to avoid creating a reality where this mysterious woman and I are married and living somewhere cool, like the PNW. “I should text her.” Back to the original girl. Damn. “Woah, that’s a really cool looking car. I wonder how long I’d have to stay at State Farm to buy it.” Too long. I hated my job before I was stuck in traffic, but now I’m ready to call my manager and quit right now, “And why not? I’m quitting in ten days anyway, how much of a difference will it make if I leave now?” A lot. it will give me another seven days of pay, which will go towards the new sunglasses I’m looking at. “I think if I work there remotely for the next year, I could get away with buying that car.” No. I hate remote work. At this moment I’m just trying to convince myself to not quit. Realistically, I couldn’t afford that car with a year of work. I don’t want to have to go into debt as young as I am. I can’t bring that into a relationship. “I should text her.” Eventually the traffic cleared up, I didn’t quit my job, I haven’t listened to Moby, but I did text her. </p>
