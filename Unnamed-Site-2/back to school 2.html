  <h1>Welcome Back to School</h1>

	    <p>Is a stereotype rude even if it’s true? Yes. But the stereotype that all students are poor isn’t inherently rude, nor is it untrue. As irony would have it, I'm the poorest when I need money the most. I have found that focusing on my dire situation doesn’t help me. Instead, I try to remember the scripture in the New Testament reminding us that God will always provide for those who follow Him. This scripture calms me and helps me see blessings and opportunities in places where I usually wouldn’t look. The library is a great place to start. You’ll find that many students leave their study materials unattended when using the restroom, making a phone call, or getting food. Macbook Airs, the unofficial computer of graphic design and social media majors, are being bought for $700 on Ebay; that’s a semester’s worth of groceries. God uses those around us to bless us, and He also blesses us line upon line. How can we expect Him to bless us with rent money or tuition money if we won’t take advantage of the grocery money he is basically putting in our pockets? No matter how dire your situation seems to you, remember that He knows you best and will provide for you one need at a time. Don’t forget to show your gratitude for your newfound increase by keeping your eye open for opportunities where you can help bless others. Pay attention to their peers surrounding them in the library. See if anyone looks like they could use a little boost. Leave your laptop out and go buy some food from the food court. Don’t be surprised if you come back and it’s still there. It may take a couple of fake phone calls and extra long bathroom visits before somebody acts on the promptings that will ultimately bless them. Be aware that when you find your computer on Marketplace, it will most likely be listed for a much lower price than what you originally paid. The Christian thing to do is to pay the original price. We are admonished to help the poor and needy, and I see no better way of doing so than paying some desperate college student $1000 for your Macbook they’re reselling for $500. Though not many people will see your generous gift, your Father in Heaven will see and will continue to bless you.&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>I have found that the male side of all apartment complexes are left unlocked when no one is home. Taking advantage of God’s blessings only opens you up to receive more of them, and this is no exception. Don’t be afraid to walk in and take a TV, a video game console, or anything else that will give you enough money to pay for that month’s rent. The more you respond to his promptings, the easier it will be to pay off the semester’s tuition and health insurance. Much like the patrons in the library, we should be attentive to the spirit’s promptings. Leave your door unlocked when you’re leaving to church or to class. Don’t be afraid to put out video game consoles under the television. By having your Switch and your roommate’s Xbox in the living room, you become God’s hands as He blesses those around you. You will see blessings that only come from serving others and God. </p>
