	  <article>With bills paid and grocery money set aside, you’re probably looking for a way to spend your time. When I first went up to BYU-I, I knew of only one other person from my hometown also attending with me. We were not living together, so that means I had to try and get to know my roommates. It was hard: I had moved in earlier than they did, and worked early in the morning to mid afternoon. Our schedules didn’t align easily, so for a week I only saw them at church on Sunday. One Saturday, I was home using my unknown roommate’s Netflix account when he came back early from a date. He went upstairs to his bedroom, but quickly came down. We chatted for a bit, exchanged names, and then came to the conclusion that we both wanted to do something other than watch Arrested Development on our couch. After discovering that we shared an interest in the newly released Ryan Reynolds movie, we decided that we wanted to watch it in a theater. We looked up showtimes and found that it was only showing in the FatCats theater the same time that another movie (Shang Chi) was playing. We wanted to watch both but were forced to choose one, or were we? In a moment of brilliance, I remembered driving past a lot that looked similar to a drive-in movie theater which advertised double features. My roommate (I’ll call him Cody to respect his privacy) looked at the featured movies and found that Free Guy and Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings were playing back to back. What luck! We quickly got in apparel suitable for a drive in theater (a flannel and a ball cap for Cody, a T-shirt and closed toe shoes for myself) and drove off in his car to pick up some snacks. We found a great bargain on Wild Berry Skittles and Peach Rings (my movie theater snack of choice), only spending $9 for enough sweets to make any real adult sick. We drove the rest of the way to the drive-in movie theater and we found that tickets were only $8 a person for two movies. That’s $4 a movie per person, what a bargain! Unfortunately, the ticket givers in this drive-in movie theater are especially restrictive on what you can or cannot bring into their premises. The vehicle ahead of us, a local Rexburgian Gentleman, had to show his paperwork regarding the firearm he had on his person. Our fears were momentarily quelled by the presence of that registered firearm, but quickly resurfaced as we looked for a spot to hide the snacks we brought in from off their property. Fortunately we were able to stuff them in my roommate’s glove compartment just as he pulled up to the ticket window. We told her what tickets we were purchasing and fortunately didn’t have to lie when she said “I don’t see any outside snacks or beverages in the car,” as she waved us through. Phew! My conscience was cleared. Not only were Cody and I engaging in a wholesome recreational activity for such a low price ($25 for the two of us!) but we didn’t have to lie. Imagine if she had asked us if we had any snacks in the car? We would have been forced to lie to an innocent employee of the drive-in movie theater. Fortunately we were able to enjoy both films in the front seats of my roommate’s Corolla. The moral of this story? Don’t wait a week to learn your roommates’ names! Take some time today to try to get to know them. Who knows! Maybe you’ll learn that you share an interest in an exciting new movie coming out. You’ll get to make a new friend while you’re off having an adventure, just the two of you!</article>
