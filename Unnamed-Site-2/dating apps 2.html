      <p>As a frequent user of dating apps, I am faced with two big decisions almost constantly: up (right), or down (left). I began on these apps filtering age (25+), distance from my location (within 10 miles), and preferred height (6’2” or taller). I’ve noticed that my filters loosen or even disappear the longer I remain single. Right now, I am currently swiping on other users who are on the other side of the country, shorter than 5’2”, and the same age as I am. Here is a list of reasons why I have swiped right (up), or left (down) on other parties also on these apps. <strong>Disclaimer: these names are not representative of any specific persons I have encountered on these apps. They serve to provide an easier experience and continuity to my readers.&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Haylee: Bleach blonde California girl. Up. Hayley: Had blonde hair, and I’m not really attracted to blondes. Down Hailee: Brunette, but a light brown. Very very pretty hair. Up. Hailey: Blonde. Very very blonde. Wow. Up.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Bailee: Dark brown hair, almost black. Very attractive. Up. Bayley: Red hair isn’t really my thing. Down. Bailey: Blonde hair isn’t my thing either. Down. Baylie: Red hair is very sexy. Wow. Up. Emily: Blonde hair. A sandy blonde hair. Very very cute. Up.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Emilee: 5’10”. I don’t want to date someone almost as tall as I am. What if I find out I’m not really 6’5”? Down. Emmalee: 5’9”. Not tall enough. I need to date someone closer to my height. Down. Emmaleigh: 6’4”. We won’t have to pay for our kids’ college. Up. Emmalie: 5’6”. Too short. People are going to think we’re siblings. Down Emelie: 5’2”. So cute. I can pick her up and carry her everywhere! Up. Emmy: 5’8”. Too short for me. Down.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Makenzee: 18. Way too young for me. I can’t go out with a teenager as someone in my early twenties! Down. Mekenzie: 27. Hmm. Might be too old for me. What if I can’t provide for her? Down. McKenzee: 19. Ok. Three years isn’t too big of an age difference. Up. Mackenzie: 18. Well, if three years isn’t too much of an age difference, then four isn’t either. Up. Mackenzy: 40. She must have so much experience. She’d be perfect to raise a family with. Up. Mackinley: 18. Not that big of an age difference. Oh wait. Is that “actually 17” in her bio? Down.</p>
