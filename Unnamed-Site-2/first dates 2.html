  <h1>First Dates</h1>
	<section>
	  <article>
	    <p>I have been on a lot of dates. Such is the life of a man who frequents dating apps as often as I do. I’ve done all sorts of things, from ice cream and a walk to bridge diving, to trespassing on some private property, to watching a meteor shower on top of some hay bales. Here is my list of the best first date ideas in Rexburg, Idaho.&nbsp;</p>
	    <p><strong>Planting</strong> <strong>Flowers</strong>:</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;It’s like you’re going on a walk, but cooler. You and a special person get to run around campus and participate in the circle of life. Participating in this inception won’t get you stuck with any alimony, but you will feel sad when you find that the garden workers picked your flowers. Just because they don’t belong there doesn’t mean they’re not beautiful! <em>Pro tip: For some extra fun, plant pumpkin, squash, or other produce and see how long until the workers pick it. If it doesn’t get picked, you and your date have successfully created and raised a living creature. Maybe it’s time to lock that one down?</em></p>
	    <p><strong>&nbsp;Mini Golf</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>This activity at face value combines two of my least favorite things: irregularly shaped sticks, and small things. You can make it more enjoyable and less expensive if you do it at the dunes. Go pick out two golf clubs from the DI or your roommate’s golf bag, pick up some ping pong balls from the school’s tables, and drive out to the Saint Anthony sand dunes. Hit the ping pong balls around and get to know your date. <em>Pro tip: Doing this at the dunes will give you some invaluable insights on your partner: how do they react to getting sand in their pants? If they are able to shrug off this minor inconvenience, run away and don’t look back. Who in their right mind can live with sand in their pants? Psychopaths, that’s who.&nbsp;</em></p>
	    <p><strong>Baseball</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>This date requires a little more money, but it’s worth it. Idaho Falls has a less than good (some would say bad) team. It’s good practice for being a BYU sports fan! Go and support the Chukars (a chicken shaped bird for those who didn’t know) and watch some local Idahoans get wasted as they desperately look for reasons to support their hometown heroes. <em>Pro tip: The ADA in ADA seating does not refer to the American Dental Association. These cost as much as general admission, but have a much better view. If you accidentally buy spots for wheelchairs instead of actual seats, the nice ticket lady will let you sit in the folding chairs they keep nearby.&nbsp;</em></p>
	    <p><strong>Porter Park</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>You can do so many things here. Bring a frisbee, soccer ball, or a swimsuit and enjoy the splash pad! There’s no age limit on the splash pad, and the water park in town is way too expensive to take a date. Go nuts as you get soaked. It’s a pretty good time. Watch out for the small children though. Knocking them over is a huge faux pas and can prematurely end your date with this hottie you’re trying to impress. <em>Pro tip: Go right before the park shuts down so any supervising parents don’t get the wrong idea. If you show up too late, go buy five large cases of water. That should be enough to go down the slides a couple times each. You’ve got to break the touch barrier somehow, so don’t be scared to ask for a push.</em></p>
