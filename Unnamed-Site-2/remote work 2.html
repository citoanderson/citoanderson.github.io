  <h1>Remote "Work"</h1>
	<section>
	  <article>
	    <p>There are a lot of incentives to find a remote job: flexible schedules, no commute, and zero dress code. No one cares if I show up to remote work wearing yesterday’s sweaty t-shirt and/or my pajama bottoms. I will take this time to rate the following activities I participated in based on how easily I got away with them.&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Instagram: I’d say this is a standard go-to when working from home. It was easy to hide my phone from any zoom cameras, and mouse jigglers kept my profile “online”. When on camera, my head was fixed in a downward tilt, making it obvious to my supervisor that my laughter didn’t come from her daily debrief. Overall, I’d rate this distraction 5.5/10. Easy to execute, but too easy to be caught.&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Television: I was able to catch up on my watchlist during my remote job. I wasn’t looking at my lap when my show was on, but I wasn’t looking at my work computer either. It’s hard to pretend like I’m working when Zach absolutely refuses to give a rose to the woman who loves him the most. Sometimes I just got too hooked on this season of the bachelor. 6.5/10.</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;Eating: Hard to eat when I’m supposed to be on the phone all day. Fortunately, I can mute myself so the clients don’t hear me chewing. If I mute them enough they’ll even hang up and then I get a couple minutes to wolf down some of my breakfast before the next caller dials in. 6.5/10.&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Online Shopping: Looks like I’m busy working on a computer. The problem is that my work computer shows I’m inactive. Definitely not as easy to get away with as it seems. 5/10.</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;Working on this blog: Same problem as shopping. Looks very busy on camera, but offline on my work computer. 5/10&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Cooking: Hard to hear the clients on the phone over the sound of bacon and eggs cooking. On camera it just looks like I’m not working, but does make a good conversation starter with my boss. 6.5/10.</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;Laundry: I’m off camera for five minutes every hour switching the loads. Hard to convince my bosses I don’t have a urination problem, but it makes for a good excuse when I need to beat my roommates to the washing machine. 7/10&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>My second job: Some weeks I was super burnt out from my remote job. I used my paid sick leave or any PTO I accrued and would take the day off from the computer and work a full day instead of a half day at Firehouse Subs. It was nice making more money from one job without taking a hit on my remote job. 8.5/10&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Bike rides: I was required to be on zoom 8 hours a day five days a week. My internet was not set up for me to make that sort of commitment. The internet was unreliable, dropping me from my zoom call. Every once in a while I would email in to my supervisors telling them I was having internet problems, but would connect in when I could. These days I would take a longer lunch or join the zoom meeting later to get some exercise in. Requires slight bending of the truth but not an outright lie. 10/10&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Actually working: horrendous. I would never recommend remote work to anyone. It’s hard to stay motivated while working a remote job. Find some fun ways to stay distracted, but not too distracted that you’ll lose your job. </p>
