    <p class="text_column">In sort of a continuation of my previous post, and as a personal matter of record, I would like to rank all the tv shows or movies I watched while “working” remotely. Similarly to the previous article, I am ranking these shows on how easy it was to work with the TV show playing in the background. </p>
    <p class="text_column">Psych: This was probably the first show I had watched from beginning to end. It is my go-to show to put on for background noise because I have seen it so many times. Every once in a while I would hear a joke or see a gag that I wasn’t anticipating, but for the most part I could get all my work done very easily. 9.5/10&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">The Lord of The Rings: I’m including the entire extended edition of the trilogy in this rating because you can’t just watch one of them. Again, a familiar story but much more attention grabbing than Psych. I was very easily distracted from my work. 2.5/10 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: Classic story but slow for large chunks of time. I was able to get a significant amount of work done during the movie but still felt like I didn’t miss anything. 8.5/10.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Upload: An Amazon Prime original show created by the guy who did the American Office. Funny, but it made it very hard to stay focused on work. 3/10. </p>
    <p class="text_column">The Outlaws: Another Amazon Prime original that had a very compelling story, great music, and impressive actors. Nearly impossible to follow along without neglecting work. 2.5/10&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column">Truth Seekers: A cute one season show about ghost hunters. Weird story, but interesting enough to distract me from my responsibilities 50% of the time. 6.5/10. American Gangster: By far the best gangster movie I have ever seen. Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe delivered captivating performances that left my jaw on the floor. My supervisor asked why I was so distracted during our morning discussion and I had to tell her that I was looking at construction outside. 1/10.</p>
    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;Bosch: An Amazon original cop show about a detective navigating the political waters after he killed a suspect. This show has one of the best gunfight scenes I’ve ever seen. Make sure that your zoom call is muted, it was hard to explain away the gunshots my boss heard as my dog’s bark in the background. 1/10. </p>
